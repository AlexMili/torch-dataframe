# Contributing

Feel free to report a bug, suggest enhancements or submit new cool features using [Issues][df_issues] or directly send us a [Pull Request][df_pr] :).

## Before submitting

Don't forget to :
- test your code
- generate the doc
- use the linter script in `specs` directory

You can find how we implemented our tests in the [specs directory][df_specs]. See "Behavior Driven Development" for more details on this technique.

## Programming book

For a better contribution we ask you to follow these simple rules to keep the code reading as smooth as possible :
* Indentation is a tabulation of size 2
* Every composants of a function's name is separated by an underscore : `my_func_name`
